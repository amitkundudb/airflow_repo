1.	Create a simple Demo DAG in Airflow to define the workflow logic. Specify the tasks, dependencies, and scheduling intervals using Python code for the Airflow UI.

2.	Explore different types of operators available in Airflow and Create tasks using the BashOperator operator to perform specific actions in your DAG.

3.	Explore different types of operators available in Airflow and Create tasks using PythonOperator operator to perform specific actions in your DAG.

4.	Explore different types of operators available in Airflow and Create tasks using the TriggerDagRunOperator operator to perform specific actions in your DAG.

5.	Define dependencies between tasks using the built-in mechanisms in Airflow. Understand how to set up upstream and downstream dependencies, task retries, and task rescheduling.

6.	Use sensors in Airflow to wait for certain conditions before proceeding with the execution of tasks. Experiment with different types of sensors, such as FileSensor, HttpSensor, and TimeSensor, to trigger tasks based on external events or data availability.
